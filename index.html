                    in Ia»ôi, specializing in Classic AUTOSAR software for automotive ECUs. 
                    My role involves coding and integrating software components into the broader system architecture, ensuring compliance
                     with industry standards.
                    
                    Working in automotive software has given me a solid foundation in Classic AUTOSAR and the development
                     of safety-critical systems for modern vehicles. I also collaborate with cross-functional teams, 
                     enhancing my understanding of the full software development lifecycle and refining my problem-solving
                     skills to meet the stringent requirements of the automotive sector.

                        Engineer,
                        where I deepened my expertise in software testing. I specialized in Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL)
                        testing while
                        adhering to ASPICE testing principles. Additionally, I had the opportunity to work on a SaaS

                        to build a test
